Task: Develop a text detection model for reading RCs


-- Submission details: 
a) prepare an excel  showing what was the text output for each image. We should be able to capture the following fields on the RC: 
- License plate number or Regn number
- VIN number or Chassis number (typically 17 digit long)
- Name
- Engine number
- Registration date
- Mfg. date


-  You can use both free and paid APIs such as AWS textract, AWS Rekognition, Google vision etc. Most paid APIs are free for the first 1000-5000 images.

-  Using logics to detect numbers. e.g. VIN numbers have 17 digit alphanumeric format  , dates have a fixed format, license plate numbers have 10 digit alphanumeric format

- Image enhancement techniques such as grayscale, contrast etc
